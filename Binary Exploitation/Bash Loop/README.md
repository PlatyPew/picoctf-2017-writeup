# Bash Loop

## Question
>We found a program that is hiding a flag but requires you to guess the number it is thinking of. Chances are Linux has an easy way to try all the numbers... Go to /problems/1341ae866a3bcee40a916de97678a0a1 and try it out!

### Hint
>Either use SSH or use the Web Shell to get onto the shell server and navigate to the correct directory. Then do a quick Google search on 'bash loops'. You may need to use grep to filter out the responses as well!

## Solution
Upon running the binary, we are greeted with this
```
$ ./bashloop
What number am I thinking of? It is between 0 and 4096
```

We can input a number in argv[1] and brute force from 0-4096 using a bash loop, as the challenge name would suggest
```
$ for i in {0..4096}; do ./bashloop $i | grep flag; done
Yay! That's the number! Here be the flag: 460b1c7b20d753cfdc17f0d4b6a01dae
```

### Flag
`460b1c7b20d753cfdc17f0d4b6a01dae`
