## Question
>QRobin handed me some color [codes](codes.txt) the other day. They don't look like anything to me though. Can you help me find her favorite shade of red?

### Hint
>Once again, there are tools on the interwebz that can help! (There's a clear theme here, from the easiest pico problems, to the hardest ones in other CTFs, search engines are your friend!)

## Solution
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens...

We are given a list of hexadecimal colour codes. We can go to [HTML Color Picker](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp)

Upon trying all of the colours, it appears that `C70002` is the only colour code that gives a shade of red.

### Flag
`C70002`
